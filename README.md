# OSSIM Mapping Archive (OMAR™) 

OMAR™ is a multi-INT data archive and retrieval service used for the exploitation of multi-INT data. Access to the data can be accomplished by either an AJAX-enabled web client or a web service request via SOAP. OMAR™ can be used to query multi-INT data sources based on geospatial bounds, sensor, collector, and temporal attributes. The imagery products and associated metadata available as a result of an OMAR™ query can be packaged in either its native format or a specified format. OMAR™ includes a data ingest stager that inserts metadata into a relational database model for subsequent retrieval.
