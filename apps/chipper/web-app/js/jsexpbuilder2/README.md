jsexpbuilder
============

Expression Builder for creating complex nested conditions/expressions using jQuery

Expression Builder is used to create nested condition /expression builder which can be used to generate complex expressions

This is still a 0.1 version where the UI works fine but the columns /conditions are hardcoded. A good place for someone looking for a decent start.

The plan is to make this into a jquery plugin. Please feel free to drop by a mail for any features you need.
